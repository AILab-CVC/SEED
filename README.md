## Brief Introduction

It is recommended to check out our [papers](#citation) for technical details.

### :speech_balloon: What can SEED-LLaMA do?

![image](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED/blob/main/paper_images/v2/teaser.jpg)

**SEED-LLaMA** is capable of both multimodal comprehension and generation, exhibiting compositional emergent abilities such as multi-turn in-context multimodal generation, acting like your AI assistant. [[Compare to SOTA]](https://ailab-cvc.github.io/seed/seed_llama_compare.html) [[More examples on X]](https://twitter.com/ge_yixiao/status/1710509538238157069?s=20)

<!-- We present **SEED-LLaMA** by large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning on the interleaved textual and visual data, which demonstrates impressive performance on a broad range of multimodal comprehension and generation tasks. More importantly, SEED-LLaMA has exhibited **compositional emergent abilities** such as multi-turn in-context multimodal generation, acting like your **AI assistant**. -->

### :bulb: How does SEED-LLaMA achieve it?

![image](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/SEED/blob/main/paper_images/seed_overview.jpg)

The core of SEED-LLaMA is the tailored **SEED** tokenizer, which properly quantized visual signals into discrete visual tokens, capturing necessary semantics while being produced under 1D causal dependence. [[SEED-2 vs. SEED-1]](https://ailab-cvc.github.io/seed/seed_llama.html)

<!-- ### Compositional Emergent Ability

**Compositional image generation.**

<!-- ### SEED Tokenizer v2
In SEED tokenizer v2, the generation embedding is aligned with the **image embedding** (1 token) of [unCLIP SD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip), and can be decoded to realistic images with the unCLIP-SD-UNet. In SEED tokenizer v1, we train a visual tokenizer through aligning the **generation embeddings** with the text embeddings (77 tokens) of [SD](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), and the generation embeddings can be decoded to images with the SD-UNet. The below figure shows the visual comparison of the reconstructed images between SEED tokenizer v2 (the third row) and SEED tokenizer v1 (the second row). We can observe that the images reconstructed by SEED tokenizer v2 can better preserve the visual information of the original images. The semantic representations of texts can not fully preserve the rich visual information of images.

<!-- ### Pretraining
We perform multimodal autoregressive pretraining on interleaved visual and textual data for SEED-LLaMA. Visual inputs are pre-processed into discrete tokens to conserve computational resources. Given the multimodal discrete sequence, a unified next-word-prediction objective is employed. During inference, visual codes are decoded into a realistic image by SEED De-Tokenization.

## Hightlights
1. We use GPT-4 to rewrite the instructions in the [InstructPix2Pix dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800), such as transforming "add a storm" into "Can you add a storm effect to the image?" and responding with "Sure, I have successfully added a storm effect to the image.". The instruction tuned model can **generate informative text and images in a single response**, as shown in the figure below (this is also an **emergent ability**).
![image](images/text_image.jpg)

2. Given a starting image and story, the instruction tuned model can **generate the following story and multiple images** in one go.
![image](images/story.jpg)

3. We use GPT-4 to generate instruction based on the text content of [MMC4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06939). The instruction tuned model can **generate image-text interleaved content** (Our released sft model does not possess this feature as we  separately instruction tune the pre-trained model on MMC4).

<!-- Please download the checkpoints and save under the folder `./pretrained`.

```bash
cd pretrained   # SEED/pretrained
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/AILab-CVC/SEED
mv SEED/* ./
``` -->

The model weights of unCLIP SD-UNet which are used to reconstruct the image will be downloaded automatically.

<!-- To reconstruct the image from the SEED visual codes using unCLIP SD-UNet, please download the pretrained [unCLIP SD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip).  -->

<!-- To reconstruct the image from the SEED visual codes using unCLIP SD-UNet, please download the pretrained [unCLIP SD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip).
Rename the checkpoint directory to **"diffusion_model"** and create a soft link to the "pretrained/seed_tokenizer" directory.

```bash
# SEED/pretrained
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip
mv stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip seed_tokenizer/diffusion_model
``` -->


### Inference for visual tokenization and de-tokenization
To discretize an image to 1D visual codes with causal dependency, and reconstruct the image from the visual codes using the off-the-shelf unCLIP SD-UNet:

```bash
cd ..   # SEED/ 
python scripts/seed_tokenizer_inference.py
```
### Inference for SEED-LLaMA
Given that SEED-LLaMA-8B is based on Vicuna-7B and SEED-LLaMA-14B based on LLaMA2-Chat-13B, we use Vicuna-7B's ("USER:", "ASSISTANT:") and LLaMA2-Chat-13B's ([INST] [/INST]) prompts for respective instruction tuning.

```bash
# Inference for SEED-LLaMA-8B
python scripts/seed_llama_inference_8B.py
```

```bash
# Inference for SEED-LLaMA-14B
python scripts/seed_llama_inference_14B.py
```


### Launching Gradio Demo of SEED-LLaMA-14B Locally 
1. Building the local demo of SEED-LLaMA-14B currently requires **single 24GB** GPU.

```bash
# SEED/
# in first terminal
bash scripts/start_backend_14b.sh

``` 

2. Building the local demo of SEED-LLaMA-8B currently requires **single 16GB** GPU.
